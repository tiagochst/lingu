txtabout=There are 6912 well known languages worldwide. In Brazil, we have 188 languages\nin use: the portuguese and more 187 indigenous languages. There is one called the apiac\u00e1, spoken by only two brazilians, and other called ofaie, practiced by 11 indians of Mato Grosso do Sul. But, of all 187 indigenous languages, about 30 of them are endangered and 47 languages that were spoken in Brazil had disappeared forever. Given the variety of languages, it is necessary to have a collection\nof documents covering all of them. Ie, it is imperative to create a web-system t\no provide digital inclusion of all small languages.
